Qilin Zhou is a 4th-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/), supervised by [Wing-Kwong Chan](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~wkchan/). He earned his B.Eng. in Software Engineering from the Outstanding Engineer Program at South China University of Technology in 2022. His research interests lie at the intersection of Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a specific focus on Formal Quality Assurance for AI.
